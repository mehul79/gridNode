# GridNode

GridNode is a distributed compute platform for running user-submitted jobs on provider-owned machines without giving requesters direct host access. A requester submits a job, a provider approves it, the backend tracks scheduling and state, and the local `computeshare-agent` executes the work inside Docker on the provider's machine.

This repository contains the full stack:

- a Next.js frontend for requesters and providers
- an Express + Prisma backend for auth, jobs, approvals, machines, logs, and artifacts
- a Python agent that registers machines, polls for work, runs Docker containers, streams logs, and uploads outputs
- Docker runner images for notebook, video, server, and data-processing workloads

## How GridNode Works

1. A requester signs in and creates a compute job.
2. The backend matches that job to a suitable machine and routes it to the provider for approval.
3. The provider reviews pending work and approves or rejects it.
4. The provider's local `computeshare-agent` polls for assigned jobs.
5. The agent prepares a workspace, runs the job in Docker, streams logs, and registers artifacts.
6. The frontend shows job state, logs, approvals, machines, and outputs.

### Main parts of the repo

- `fe/`
  Requester/provider UI built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui.
- `be/`
  Control plane built with Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Better Auth, Socket.IO, and S3 helpers.
- `agent/computeshare_agent/`
  Owner-side agent CLI and runtime. This is the code behind `computeshare-agent`.
- `docker/`
  Base images and workload-specific runner images used by the agent.

## Current Capabilities

The repo already contains working code for:

- Google-based sign-in via Better Auth
- job creation, listing, filtering, detail pages, and stop actions
- provider approval and rejection flows
- machine registration, listing, and reclaim actions
- live job logs and artifact views in the frontend
- agent registration and long-lived session token creation
- agent heartbeat, job polling, job status updates, artifact registration, and log ingestion
- Docker-based execution plumbing for notebook, video, server, and data-processing jobs

## Architecture Snapshot

- Frontend:
  Next.js app for login, dashboard, jobs, approvals, and machines
- Backend:
  source of truth for users, machines, approvals, jobs, logs, and artifacts
- Agent:
  execution plane running on the provider's machine
- Docker images:
  workload runtimes stored under `docker/`

At a high level, the backend owns coordination and state, while the agent performs execution on provider hardware.

## Local Development Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL accessible through `DATABASE_URL`
- Google OAuth credentials for Better Auth if you want login to work end-to-end
- Docker if you plan to run or test the agent

### Backend

```bash
cd be
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set at least these values in `be/.env`:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3005`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Optional env vars already supported in the repo include AWS and Kaggle credentials:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
- `KAGGLE_USERNAME`
- `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`

Then start the backend:

```bash
cd be
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

The backend listens on `http://localhost:3005`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd fe
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

By default, the frontend talks to the backend at `http://localhost:3005`.

## New User: Connect Your Machine

If you want to provide compute to GridNode, this is the current Linux-first flow:

1. Start the frontend and backend.
2. Sign in through the web app.
3. Open the machines page at `/machines`.
4. Generate or copy your personal agent registration key.
5. Install the agent locally on the machine you want to connect.
6. Run the agent for first-time registration:

```bash
computeshare-agent start --token <your-agent-key> --backend http://localhost:3005
```

On first run, the agent registers the machine and stores its long-lived config locally. After that, you can start it without the one-time registration key:

```bash
computeshare-agent start
```

## Agent Install Details

The current agent onboarding is repo-based and Linux-first. It is not yet packaged as a polished public download or release flow.

### What the current Linux installer expects

- Python `3.9+`
- Docker installed and available on `PATH`
- `sudo` access for system-level setup
- an Ubuntu/Debian-style environment with `apt-get`, because the installer sets up `runsc`/gVisor and restarts Docker

### Current install path in this repo

The installer lives at `agent/computeshare_agent/install.sh`, and it expects a built binary at:

```text
agent/computeshare_agent/dist/computeshare-agent
```

That means the current flow is:

```bash
cd agent/computeshare_agent
./build.sh
./install.sh
```

After installation, start the agent with:

```bash
computeshare-agent start --token <your-agent-key> --backend http://localhost:3005
```

On later runs:

```bash
computeshare-agent start
```

### What the installer does

- verifies Python and Docker
- installs `runsc` / gVisor
- restarts Docker
- copies the built `computeshare-agent` binary into `/usr/local/bin`

### Windows note

There is also a Windows installer stub at `agent/computeshare_agent/install.bat`, but the Linux flow is the more current path reflected by this repo and its system setup assumptions.

## API and Product Surface

Some of the main user- and agent-facing flows exposed by the repo are:

- `/machines`
  generate a personal machine registration key and manage connected machines
- `/jobs`
  create, view, filter, and stop jobs
- `/approvals`
  review and decide pending provider approvals
- `computeshare-agent start --token <key> --backend <url>`
  first-run machine registration
- `computeshare-agent start`
  subsequent agent startup using saved config

## Known Gaps and Current Limitations

- The agent install/distribution story is still rough and repo-oriented.
- Some older docs in the repo still describe parts of the system as planned or use outdated paths.
- The agent defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if `--backend` is omitted, while the backend in this repo runs on `http://localhost:3005`, so the README should always use the explicit backend flag for local setup.
- The project still has hackathon-level edges around packaging, hardening, and cross-platform polish.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Express, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Better Auth, Socket.IO
- Agent: Python
- Execution: Docker plus workload-specific images under `docker/`

## Why This README Exists

This root README is the canonical repo-level introduction for:

- someone trying to understand what GridNode is
- a developer trying to run the stack locally
- a provider trying to connect a machine with the agent

If you need deeper implementation detail, the backend, frontend, and agent directories contain the code and supporting docs for each subsystem.
